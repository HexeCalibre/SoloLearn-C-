# Practice Exercise: Inheritance

## Objective
🎯 The objective of this exercise is to practice inheritance in object-oriented programming by completing the implementation of a Car class that inherits from a Vehicle class.

## Task
🛠️ The program provided takes the brand and model of a car as input and defines a Vehicle class with a model property and ShowModel() method. Your task is to complete the Car class so that it inherits from the Vehicle class and adds the Model property and ShowModel() method.

## Instructions
1. Open the provided program file.
2. Complete the Car class to inherit from the Vehicle class.
3. Add the Model property and ShowModel() method to the Car class.
4. Ensure that the ShowModel() method correctly displays the model of the car.
5. Test the program with the provided sample input and verify that the output matches the sample output.

## Sample Input

```shell
🚗 BMW
5 Series
```

## Sample Output
```shell
🏷️ Brand: BMW
📄 Model: 5 Series
```
