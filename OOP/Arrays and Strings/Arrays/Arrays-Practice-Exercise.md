# PRACTICE EXERCISE : Arrays

A game machine has 5 games installed on it:

```cs
string[] games = { "Alien Shooter", "Tic Tac Toe", "Snake", "Puzzle", "Football" }; 
```

Write a program to take **N** number as input and output the corresponding game with **N** index from the array.

If user enters an invalid number that is out of array range, the program should output "Invalid number".

**Sample Input**
3

**Sample Output**
Puzzle

> Remember the first element of the array has **0 index.**

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace SoloLearn
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] games = { "Alien Shooter", "Tic Tac Toe", "Snake", "Puzzle", "Football" };

            //your code goes here
            
        }
    }
}
```
