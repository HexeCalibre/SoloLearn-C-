# PRACTICE EXERCISE : Constructors 
Your graphic application needs to report that a new project has been created successfully once the "Create" button has been pressed.

Complete the given class by adding a constructor that will show message "Project created" once the operation is done.

> You need to execute the output **inside** the constructor.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace SoloLearn
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Project project = new Project();
        }
    }
    class Project
    {
        //create a constructor to show "Project created"
        
    }
}
```
